Once upon a time, a group of Improvisers asked themselves: 
Can science be fun… and scientists funny🤔? 

Find out the answer by watching our newest POP UP concept: science and improv 🧬. POP UP LAB is an innovative show where improvisers and scientists take the audience on a hilarious—and completely improvised—journey of discovery through scientific breakthroughs with the aim to discredit pseudo-science and manufactured controversies. 💻
Improv is a form of theatre made up on the spot. It’s interactive, effervescent...and fun! And POP UP LAB argues the need for a ‘natural’ embedding of science in society in an informal and relaxed format through improvisation: a bridge from the academic &quot;ivory tower&quot; to the wider public.
